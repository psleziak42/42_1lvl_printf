# Printf

Pretty straightforward: it is my own printf function. It covers following:
  conversions: c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, %
  flags: precision, width, "-", 0, "*", "."
  
To run, download the repository, type make (if not working make all) in bash. Executable will run automatically because it is linked inside makefile. To test you can edit file ft_printfMain.c. After editing type make again.
